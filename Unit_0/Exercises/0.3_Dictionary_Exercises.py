0.3 Dictionary Practice

    1) Given the following dictionary of favorite colors by person:

            favorites = {
            "Alice": "blue",
            "Marcus": "green",
            "Jenna": "purple"
        }

        Write code that prints Jenna’s favorite color using syntax that references a dictionary.

    2) Using the same dictionary from Exercise 1, add a new person:

        "Riley": "orange"

        Then print the updated dictionary.

    3) Marcus decides their new favorite color is yellow.
        Update the dictionary so it reflects that change.


    4) Create a new dictionary where the keys become values and the values become keys.

         HINT - Use a for loop that loops through both the keys and values of the favorites dictionary
